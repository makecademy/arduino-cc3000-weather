# WiFi Weather Station [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openhomeautomation/arduino-cc3000-weather.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/openhomeautomation/arduino-cc3000-weather)

This is the code for the "Make a WiFi Weather Station With Arduino and the CC3000 chip" article on the Open Home Automation website. The article is about remotely measuring temperature & humidity with Arduino and the CC3000 WiFi chip.

The repository contains three folders:
- interface: the interface to display the data on your computer
- sensor_test: the Arduino sketche to test the DHT sensor
- wifi_weather_station: the main Arduino sketch of the project
